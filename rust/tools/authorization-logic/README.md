# An Authorization Logic

This directory contains a research prototype implementation of an authorization
logic. Authorization logic is a style of policy language for authorization -
deciding whether or not performing some action should be allowed. Examples of
authorization logics include
[ABLP](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/gdp/publications/Calculus_for_Access_Control.pdf),
[Binder](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~guttman/cs564/papers/binder.pdf),
[SecPal](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~dg/teaching/lis2014/modules/authorization-1-becker07.pdf),
and [NAL](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/fbs/publications/NexusNalRationale.pdf). At
time of writing, this prototype is about the same as SecPal. A longer
description of authorization logic is given below, followed by instructions.

This authorization logic compiles programs from the source language into the
[Souffle](https://souffle-lang.github.io/index.html) implementation of Datalog.
Souffle should be installed by following
[these instructions](https://souffle-lang.github.io/install).

## Summary of Authorization Logic

### Logic Programming

Authorization logics extend some logic programming language (e.g. Datalog,
Prolog), and permit an action only when a specific predicate can be proved using
inference rules and facts written in this language. Generally, authorization
logic is paired with a reference monitor that interprets the policy language and
permits the guarded actions only when presented with a proof of the proposition
used to grant access.

### Principals and decentralization

The key feature of authorization logic is that facts are decentralized - each
fact or rule is attributed to a principal (or actor). For example,
`HR says isManager(Alice)` means that `HR` believes or claims that
`isManager(Alice)` is true. Decentralizing facts in this way ensures that a
resource owner retains control over access to resources in an environment with
mutually distrusting principals. As an example, to use the rule

```
"FileServer" says canAccess(file, requestor) :- isManager(requestor),
                                              isValidFile(file).
```

requires proving that `FileServer` says `isManager(requestor)` and
`FileServer says isValidFile(file)`.

### Delegation

Because authorization logic models beliefs held by various parties rather than a
single global truth believed by all, we need a way to export facts from one
principal to another. In authorization logic, this is done by delegation. For
example:

```
FileServer says HR canSay isManager(x).
```

means that `HR says isManager(x)` implies `FileServer says isManager(x)`. The
exact language-level construct for delegation has varied among authorization
logics, but the key point is that this gives one principal (`FileServer`) a way
of specifying when it believes claims made by another (`HR`). Delegations can
also be done conditionally by placing them on the left of a proof rule.

### Authenticating policies

When `FileServer` imports a policy statement from `HR`, we want to know that a
claim genuinely originated from `HR`. To authenticate policy statements, each
principal is also associated with an asymmetric key-pair. When a policy
statement is exported by a principal, the statement is digitally signed, the
signature is sent to the recipient along with a serialization of the policy
claim, and the recipient uses the public key to check the signature.

## Instructions

### Running a program

To compile a program called FILENAME stored in INPUT_DIR, run:

```
cargo run -- --in-dir INPUT_DIR --out-dir OUTPUT_DIR FILENAME
```

which will result in a Souffle file called FILENAME.dl in OUTPUT_DIR. INPUT_DIR
and OUTPUT_DIR are optional, and will use the current working directory if
unspecified. If Souffle is installed, it will be run on the generated code.

To see more details of how to compile a program, including other command-line
options available, run:

```
cargo run -- --help
```

### Language Guide

#### Statements, variables, and constants

Programs are sequences of assertions that are attributed to principals which we
call statements. Statements can either be _facts_ of the form

```
<principal_name> says <predicate_name>(arg_0, ..., arg_n).
```

meaning that the principal believes predicate (applied to its arguments) to be
true, or _rules_ of the form

```
<principal_name> says <predicate_name>(arg_0, ..., arg_n) :-
    <pred_0>(arg_0, ..., arg_n), ..., <pred_n>(arg_0, ..., arg_n).
```

which specify the conditions under which the principal believes the predicate on
the left side of the rule.

For example, if we have the rule:

```
"Alice" says somePred(x) :- condition(x).
```

we can combine this with the fact `"Alice" says condition(x)` to prove
`"Alice" says somePred(x)`.

When writing facts or rules, the arguments to predicates can either be constants
or variables. Constants are written in quotes whereas variables are not. For
example,

```
"Alice" says somePred("x") :- condition("x").
```

gives a rule for proving somePred for just a particular argument, `"x"`, whereas
the same rule replaced with `x` can be applied to any argument about which we
can prove `"Alice" says condition(x)`.

Principals and other kinds of arguments share the same syntax -- they can be any
sequence of lower or uppercase letters and digits, but they must begin with a
letter. For constants, the same syntax is used within the quotes.

Principal names can also be used as arguments to predicates, and quotes are used
indicate whether a principal is a constant or variable in the same way.

Multiple rules/facts stated by the same principal can be grouped together using
curly braces, as in:

```
"Alice" says {
    rule1(x) :- condition(x).
    rule2(y) :- condition1(y), condition(x).
    someFact(x).
}
```

#### Delegation

Delegation works by prepending a predicate on the left of a fact or rule with
`<principal_name> canSay`. Delegations can only appear on the left side of a
rule. As an example, the rule

```
"Alice" says "Bob" canSay pred(x) :- condition(x).
```

can be combined with `"Alice" says condition("y")` and `"Bob" says pred("y")` to
prove `Alice says pred("y")`.

#### Attributes and canActAs

Predicates can be used to represent attributes of principals or other
constants/variables using the syntax `principal_name predicate_name(<args>)`,
such as, `"Manager" hasTraining("interviewing")`. Attributes can appear in facts
or in the left or right of a rule.

Attributes can be passed from one principal to another using `canActAs`. If
`A canActAs B`, then `A` inherits all the attributes of `B`. For example,

```
"HR" says "Alice" canActAs "Manager".
```

can be combined with `"HR" says "Manager" hasTraining("interviewing")` to prove
`"HR" says "Alice" hasTraining("interviewing")`.

Combining attributes with `canActAs` gives a way to define _roles_ which group
privileges together.

#### Queries

Queries test if it is possible to prove a specific predicate given the facts and
rules. Queries can be written using the syntax:

```
<query_name> = query <principal_name> says <predicate_name>(<args>)?
```

If the program contained queries (described below), then the there will also be
a file called `<query_name>.csv` for each query. The query is true if the CSV
contains one entry and is false otherwise.

#### Importing and Exporting statements

Statements can be imported/exported from potentially untrusted sources such as
remote machines or storage. To authenticate statements, they are digitally
signed using ECDSA signatures when exporting, and the signatures are checked
when importing.

To support exporting, a principal must be bound to a private key. Private and
public keys must be serialized in JSON. See
[tink-rust](https://github.com/project-oak/tink-rust) for a way to generate
key-pairs and see
[this code](https://github.com/project-oak/tink-rust/blob/main/core/src/keyset/json_io.rs)
to better understand the serialization format for the keys. Private keys must be
serialized in plaintext, so care must be taken. Anyone with a principal's
private key can write (possibly forged) signatures as this principal, so the
system in which this policy language is used must ensure these keys are only
accessible by the right party. Future versions of this software may also support
key management services such as
[Google Key Management](https://cloud.google.com/security-key-management) or
[AWS Key Management Service](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/).

A private key is bound to a principal using the syntax

```
BindPrivKey "<principal_name>" full/path/to/priv_key.json
```

Statements can be exported using the syntax:

```
<principal_name> says {
    <statement_0> ...
    <statement_n>
} exportTo full/path/to/filename
```

where the filename does not include a file extension. During compilation, this
will generate:

- 1. filename.obj -- a serialization of the list of statements (currently
     serialization is just done in binary), and
- 2. filename.sig -- an ECDSA signature of the list of statements using the
     private key bound to `<principal_name>`.

To import a list of statments, a principal is bound to a public key using the
syntax:

```
BindPubKey "<principal_name>" full/path/to/pub_key.json
```

after which statements are imported using

```
import <principal_name> full/path/to/filename
```

(where a file extension is omitted). When importing, the key bound to the
importing principal is checked against the signature and object files. If the
check succeeds this is treated as
`<importing_principal_name> says { assertions }`. Note that the principal name
used in the exporting context could differ from the one used in the importing
context.
