//! This file has the top level function, `compile`
//! to compile to souffle. This is a separate file and module from
//! souffle-interface because part of the compilation step involces
//! importing and exporting claims. The importing and exporting of claims
//! happens at the AST level rather than an IR and works independently of the
//! fact that the particular choice of solver is datalog. This separation might
//! make it easier to switch to a different solver later. This is also separate
//! from main because "compile" is also used for tests.
