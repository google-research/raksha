//! The file `handle_imports` is a compiler pass that imports assertions made by
//! another principal by deserializing them from a file. Imported
//! assertions must be accompanied by an ECDSA signature (also serialized) and
//! using a keypair that is assocated with the principal
//! that made the assertion. The signature is checked during this pass.
//! If the signature checks pass, the imported assertions are added
//! to the AST.
