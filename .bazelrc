# TODO(#167): Remove `-Wno-deprecated-declarations` when glog is updated.

build --cxxopt='-std=c++17'
build --cxxopt='-Werror' --cxxopt='-Wall'
build --cxxopt='-Wno-deprecated-declarations'
build --host_cxxopt='-std=c++17'
# Note: We usually try to keep the cxxopt and host_cxxopt consistent. That is
# not a good idea for this line. It appears that adding -Werror to host_cxxopt
# causes the compiler to use this flag when building dependencies that we build
# from source. This causes the build to fail if our source dependencies are not
# warning-clean. We also comment out -Wall so that we do not receive extra
# warnings from our third party packages.
# build --host_cxxopt='-Werror' --host_cxxopt='-Wall'
build --host_cxxopt='-Wno-deprecated-declarations'
