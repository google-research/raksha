//
// 1. Encapsulating the reversed vector prevents us from having to reason

// except for move constructors. We define no "add", "insert", etc. methods;
// "mutation" is done only by constructing a new object from a previous
// object. That prevents many forms of state-manipulation bugs.
//
// 3. The name AccessPathSelectors is a bit more self-documenting.
