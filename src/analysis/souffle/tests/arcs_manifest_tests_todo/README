These tests are imported from the original Arcs repo. They are here because we do not yet correctly
handle the end-to-end process of parsing them, converting them to protos, converting those protos
to Datalog, and running the dataflow analysis on them.

At the time of this writing, these tests are exact copies of the tests from the Arcs repo.
Unfortunately, these tests contain a lot of duplicated code; we should condense them somehow in the
future (tracked by Issue #64).
