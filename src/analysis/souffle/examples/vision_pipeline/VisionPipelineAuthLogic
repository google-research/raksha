// May / Will:
// These are used to specify allowed usages and a check that only the allowed 
// usages are done. The check depends on the taint analysis. Roughly:
//
// For each particle P, for each tag t in union over tags in read edges of P,
//      for each statement of the form:
//          `P says will <RELATION> using <TAG>`
//      prove
//          `ownsTag(Q, <TAG>)`
//          `Q says may <RELATION> using <TAG>`
//
// Notably "may" is a keyword rather than just another relation itself because it 
// seems useful to let usages be arbitrary relations (with potentially varying 
// signatures).
